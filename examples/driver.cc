// To handle code using several SIMD ISAs in one binary (like with
// highway's foreach_target mechanism) I prefer to split the examples
// in two: this TU, the driver, is compiled without any ISA-specific
// flags and contains 'main' which in turn calls a plain old function
// in the 'payload' TU which does the dispatching. The payload TU can
// be compiled in different ways - be it with highway's foreach_target,
// or with a single ISA-specific set of compiler flags.

#include <iostream>

namespace project

  int payload ( int argc , char * argv[] ) ;

int main ( int argc , char * argv[] )
{
  int success = project::payload ( argc , argv ) ;
