/*! \file prefilter.h

    \brief Code to create the coefficient array for a b-spline.

    This is a port from vspline/prefilter.h

    Note: the bulk of the code was factored out to filter.h, while this text still
    outlines the complete filtering process.
    
    B-spline coefficients can be generated in two ways (that I know of): the first
    is by solving a set of equations which encode the constraints of the spline.
    A good example of how this is done can be found in libeinspline. I term it
    the 'linear algebra approach'. In this implementation, I have chosen what I
    call the 'DSP approach'. In a nutshell, the DSP approach looks at the b-spline's
    reconstruction as a convolution of the coefficients with a specific kernel. This
    kernel acts as a low-pass filter. To counteract the effect of this filter and
    obtain the input signal from the convolution of the coefficients, a high-pass
    filter with the inverse transfer function to the low-pass is used. This high-pass
    has infinite support, but can still be calculated precisely within the bounds of
    the arithmetic precision the CPU offers, due to the properties it has.
    
    I recommend [CIT2000] for a formal explanation. At the core of my prefiltering
    routines there is code from Philippe Thevenaz' accompanying code to this paper,
    with slight modifications translating it to C++ and making it generic.
    The greater part of this file deals with 'generifying' the process and to
    employing multithreading and the CPU's vector units to gain speed.
    
    This code makes heavy use of vigra, which provides handling of multidimensional
    arrays and efficient handling of aggregate types - to only mention two of it's
    many qualities. Explicit vectorization is done with Vc, which allowed me to code
    the horizontal vectorization I use in a generic fashion. If Vc is not available,
    the code falls back to presenting the data so that autovectorization becomes
    very likely - a technique I call 'goading'.
    
    In another version of this code I used vigra's BSplineBase class to obtain prefilter
    poles. This required passing the spline degree/order as a template parameter. Doing it
    like this allows to make the Poles static members of the solver, but at the cost of
    type proliferation. Here I chose not to follow this path and pass the spline order as a
    parameter to the spline's constructor, thus reducing the number of solver specializations
    and allowing automated testing with loops over the degree. This variant may be slightly
    slower. The prefilter poles I use are precalculated externally with gsl/blas and polished
    in high precision to provide the most precise data possible. this avoids using
    vigra's polynomial root code which failed for high degrees when I used it.
