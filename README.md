# zimt - C++ template library to process n-dimensional arrays with multithreaded SIMD code

zimt is the German word for cinnamon, and it sounds vaguely like SIMD. It should imply something spicy and yummy, and apart from the silly pun there is no deaper meaning.

The code in this library is based on code from my library [vspline](https://bitbucket.org/kfj/vspline/ "git repository of the vspline library"). I found that the tools I developed there to process n-dimensional arrays with multithreaded SIMD code would be useful outside of a b-spline library's context, and that I might be better off letting go of the [vigra](http://ukoethe.github.io/vigra/ "The VIGRA Computer Vision Library") library, which I use in vspline for data handling and small aggregates.

In zimt, I provide a type for small aggregate, named 'xel_t' - xel is for things like pi*xel*s etc., and a type for multidimensional arrayswith arbitrary striding, named array_t/view_t . These stand in for the use of vigra::TinyVector and vigra::MultiArray(View) in vspline - vspline does not use much else from vigra, and the vigra library is very large, so I decided to replace these types with my own stripped-down versions to reduce a rather cumbersome dependency.

The next important component is a type system for SIMD data. zimt provides a common interface to four different SIMD backends, which allows for easy prototyping, switching of backend library/code base, cherrypicking, etc. The interface is modelled after Vc::SimdArray, which was the first SIMD data type I used extensively. It's part of the [Vc](https://github.com/VcDevel/Vc/ "SIMD Vector Classes for C++") library and it's well-thought-out and pretty much just what I wanted, but Vc is now 'in maintenance mode' and newer ISAs and processors are no longer supported. Much of Vc's functionality made it into the C++ std::simd standard, and that's the second backend zimt supports. The third one is [highway](https://github.com/google/highway/ "Performance-portable, length-agnostic SIMD with runtime dispatch"), which is a more recent development. It's conceptually quite different from Vc and std::simd, but my interface 'bends it' to something more like Vc, using highway functionality to implement the highway 'flavour' of zimt. Finally, there's a simple small container type (similar to zimt::xel_t) which exhibits the same interface, but uses snall loops and hopes for their autovectorization by the compiler's optimizer - a technique I call 'goading'.

Next in line is a unary functor type which I call a 'bimodal functor', because it offers two member functions 'eval', one for scalar data and one for SIMD-capable data types. The bimodal functors inherit from zimt::unary_functor and offer rudimentary functional composition, which can produce complex functors from simple ones to code, e.g., pixel pipelines for image processing - or, in other words - stencil code.

What brings it all together is a body of code which performs a cuncurrent iterations over arbitrary nD arrays of fundamentals or 'xel' data, picking out chunks of data, vectorizing them to SIMD-capable types and invoking the bimodal functors on them, storing back the results to the same or another array. These functions go by the name of 'transform-like' functions, because they are similar to std::transform. There's a variety of these functions, allowing processing of the data or their coordinates, and also reductions.
